"""``POST /v1/ocr`` — document extraction.

The Cortecs and Mistral shape, because it is the one the ecosystem already
speaks: `model` plus a `document`, and back comes `pages[]` of markdown with a
`usage_info` carrying `pages_processed`. A RAG pipeline that can point its
document-extractor setting at Mistral can point it here instead, and then the
choice of *which* extractor runs becomes an administrator's grant rather than a
setting in somebody's tool.

The same pipeline as every other metered route (resolve, check access, reserve,
call, record, settle), with four differences that come from the shape of the
operation rather than from preference:

**The unit is a page.** Not a token, and not a millionth of one. Cost comes from
`model_prices.per_page`, the count from the counterparty's `pages_processed`,
and neither is inferred from the length of the returned text — that would be a
billing figure with no source.

**The reservation is a floor, not a worst case.** Every other surface can bound
its bill before the call: chat has `max_tokens`, images have `n`. A document's
page count is unknown until it has been read, and there is no field to bound it
unless the caller supplied `pages`. So admission reserves what it can prove — the
page selection if there is one, otherwise a single page — and the real count is
settled afterwards. The consequence is stated because it is real and not
hypothetical: **a caller close to their ceiling can exceed it with one large
document.** The alternative, reserving a pessimistic maximum, refuses ordinary
requests that would have fitted, and refusing the many to bound the one is a
worse trade for a ceiling that is already checked again at settle.

**Redaction cannot run on the way out, and matters more on the way back.** With
`document_url` the provider fetches the document itself, so the bytes never
reach us and there is nothing to inspect. What returns is the document as text,
which is where a scanned identity card becomes searchable — so this is the one
surface where the response is the sensitive half.

**Never streamed.** The API has no streaming form, and a partial transcription
is not billable output.
